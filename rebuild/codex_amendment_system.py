Codex Amendment System - Phase 3.3 Implementation

This module implements the Codex Amendment System, which provides the constitutional mechanism
to enact integration recommendations as sovereign law, completing the full lifecycle from
discovery to lawful evolution.

Key Features:
- Constitutional amendment proposal framework
- Amendment analysis and impact assessment
- Ratification process and voting mechanisms
- Codex evolution tracking and versioning
- Amendment validation and conflict resolution
- Constitutional integrity preservation
