# Contributing to Djinn Kernel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Djinn Kernel project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this mathematical foundation for sovereign identity anchoring and system orchestration.

## Project Overview

The Djinn Kernel is a sophisticated AI system implementing Kleene's Recursion Theorem for sovereign identity anchoring and mathematical completion through violation pressure dynamics. It provides a mathematical foundation for creating self-sustaining recursive identities that demand mathematical completion.
